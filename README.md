## Description
This dating app, developed with Flutter, leverages the BLoC pattern for state management and Firebase as a remote database. Users can swipe to make matches and, upon a successful match, proceed to private messaging. The app is designed to handle user interactions and profile management comprehensively, providing a seamless experience for users.

## ❗Project Objective
In this project, I utilized the BLoC pattern for state management. I learned to interact with native functions, started implementing dependency injection (DI), and gained a solid understanding of Firebase and its ecosystem. I worked with GoRouter for efficient navigation and created an attractive design. To ensure a superior user experience, I implemented image caching for faster photo loading.

## ⚡️ Technologies Involved
**cached_network_image**: Used for efficiently loading and caching images from the network, ensuring a smoother and faster user experience when displaying images. <br />
**firebase_core**: Essential for initializing Firebase in the Flutter application, enabling seamless integration of various Firebase services. <br /> 
  **firebase_storage**: Utilized for storing and retrieving user-uploaded files, such as profile pictures and other media, providing a secure and scalable storage solution. <br /> 
  **cloud_firestore**: Managed and synced data in real-time, allowing for the creation of a dynamic and responsive database for the application. <br /> 
  **firebase_auth**: Integrated to handle user authentication, including sign-up, login, and password management, ensuring secure access to the application. <br />
**flutter_bloc**: Implemented to provide a predictable and manageable state management solution across the application through the BLoC (Business Logic Component) design pattern.<br />
**get_it**: Managed dependency injection, making it easier to handle and access various services and components throughout the app.<br />
**go_router**: Simplified navigation and deep linking within the application, providing a more organized and maintainable routing system.<br />
**image_picker**: Used for picking images from the device's library or taking new pictures with the camera, facilitating user interaction with media.<br />
**shared_preferences**: Used to check for the first launch of the application.
